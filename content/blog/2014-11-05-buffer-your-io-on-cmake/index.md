A small CMake optimisation win that's probably worth sharing.

Calling

```
file (APPEND
```

canÂ **massively** impact your configure time performance. Especially on Windows, where it appears that filesystem writes are unbuffered (at least this is the case for CMake on Windows or Windows generally. I'm not sure).

**BufferedIO.cmake**

```
set (MY_FILE_CONTENTS)
foreach (VAR RANGE 500)
    list (APPEND MY_FILE_CONTENTS "${VAR}\n")
endforeach ()
file (WRITE output ${MY_FILE_CONTENTS})
```

**AppendEverything.cmake**

```cmake
set (MY_FILE_CONTENTS)
foreach (VAR RANGE 500)
    file (APPEND output "${VAR}\n")
endforeach ()
```

```shell
$ time cmake -P BufferedIO.cmake

real 0m.032s
user 0m0.000s
sys 0m0.000s
```

```shell
$ time cmake -P AppendEverything.cmake

real 0m.657s
user 0m0.000s
sys 0m0.000s
```

Ouch.
