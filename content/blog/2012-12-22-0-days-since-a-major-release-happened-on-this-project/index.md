Congratulations to the E17 project on their [recent release](http://enlightenment.org/p.php?p=news/show&l=en&news_id=77). E17 was probably the longest project running without a major release that I know of, certainly beating the compiz release lull between 0.8.6 and 0.9.0.

To the E17 team - enjoy the moment!
