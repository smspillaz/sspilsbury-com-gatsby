Before 2020, remote work was still kind of a niche thing. Outside of
the tech and startup bubble, the default was that work happened in the
office and remote was definitely treated as something
that maybe only "[certain types](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/working_home)" of people would do.

Of course then 2020 happened and a lot of organisations were thrown into remote work
as-the-norm because that was (and still is, in many places), the prevailing health advice.

Now as working from home is starting to become no-longer-mandatory in some parts of the world,
there are no shortage of columns telling us why remote is going to stick, or why its an abberation
that some can't wait to get rid of.

As usual, the reality, I think, depends on context. If people learned anything in 2020, you can't
just take your regular office job, send the workers to work from their home office in exactly the same
way, and call it a day. Remote needs an entirely different *style* of working to work well and it
also suits some types of work much better than others.

# A history of anecdotes

Like the minority of workers before 2020, I have a somewhat different perspective on all this
commentary, because I started our my career remote and have worked remotely during my career
longer than I have worked in offices. I also have a pretty mixed opinion about remote work, but
interestingly enough, how I feel about remote work differs depending on what kind of work I am doing
at the time. So in this post, I'll take a trip down memory lane and try to distill why I think
remote work "worked" in certain roles and why it has been a bit "meh" in others.
