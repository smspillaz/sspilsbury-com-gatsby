        Currently I work full-time as a Doctoral Candidate at the Aalto University School of Science.

        I am open to discussing summer-work and internship opportunities, as long as they 
        are related to my current line of <link to={'/research'}>research</link> and there is an opportunity
        to publish an incorporate research done at the internship in my Doctoral Thesis.

Outside of research, I have about 5 years of experience doing software engineering,
mostly at product focused organizations. I have managed substantial features from design, to shipping and post shipping maintenance and support.

In terms of technical skills, I would say that I am fairly proficient with Python and C++. The coursework for my Master degree at Aalto was fairly comprehensive and covered a range of topics, including Algorithms, Mathematics and Machine Learning applied to Vision, Speech, Language and Robotics. My framework of choice for Deep Learning is PyTorch. I'd say that my main only weak spot is a lack of experience "big data" type frameworks like Spark, but it would be nice to have some more exposure to them.
